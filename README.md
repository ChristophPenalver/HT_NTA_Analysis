# HT_NTA_Analysis
High throughput analysis of NTA data to evaulate particle interaction. Also gives results of general NTA analysis

HT-NTA analysis will start by using the Main Code. All other functions or scripts are used to further evaluate or import data,etc. 
For using the code the raw data has to be from a NTA software export in order to work. TheScipts and functions are tailired to this 
file format and will only work with that, unless the code is changed. 

Presented code uses other algorithms like export_fig (check Mathworks) and a tracking algorithm developed by J.Roller. We didn't implement this code here. For further inforamtion please contact us.
